# Introduction

I am tracking the tutorial from this video: ["TDD Full Course (Learn Test Driven Development with Python)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAPmXQ0dC7Q) by Wes Doyle.

## 3 Rules of TDD

1. Write a failing test first.

2. Write just enough test to fail.

3. Write just enough code to pass.
